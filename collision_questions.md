Questions for Alex A:

as soon as time collides they become unable to move. How do we reset that?

sprite can move around but seems to be colliding one tile too soon - see the large padding


Learnings for our presentation:

start with a much smaller mvp idea
as tempting as it is to think of creating a foundation for the bigger project it os better to create the simplest thing and build from there.

e.g. we were testing collisions on a busy tilemap and that may have thrown false info at us.
