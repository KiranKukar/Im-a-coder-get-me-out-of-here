As a team we were tasked with creating a game that offered a player, coding based questions with the purpose of creating a fun interactive educational programme. 
* Objective : Help budding new dev’s get to grips with basic randomised coding questions.
* MI5 theme : Character wakes up after a heavy night out with their colleagues, only to find themselves locked in a basement — the escape is on!

- clone the repo to your machine
- make sure you have python3 installed
- make sure you have the dependencies installed: pygame, pygame_gui, tkinter
- cd inside the game directory!
- run 'python3 game.py'
